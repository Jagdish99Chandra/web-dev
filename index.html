        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
        Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
        development can range from developing a simple single static page of
        plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and

          <h3> 1. ANALYZE</h3>
          <p>
            No strategy is effective without a properly drawn up plan, and no
            plan can take shape without some initial analysis. In order to
            provide effective consultation, we must first understand everything
            we are working with. As clients first start with us, we spend a bit
            of time understanding the current state, goals, accomplishments,
            failures, and everything in between about their business so that we
            can avoid crossing over the same paths that did not once work.

          <h3>2. PLAN</h3>
          <p>
            Once we understand you a bit better, we then actually form plans.
            These are not just treasure maps with dotted lines drawn toward an X
            – they are milestone driven, data centric, and results oriented
            plans that are broken by monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, or annual
            stretches, entirely dependent on what works best for you to grow
            your business.

          <h3>3. REVIEW</h3>
          <p>
            Plans are also more than just a set of directions; they are also a
            dialog. We review our strategies with you to ensure that they align
            with your own growth strategies. Most importantly, we want to make
            sure they ultimately compliment your own efforts, and we can
            implement ways that compound your growth into the internet sphere.

          <h3>4. OPTIMIZE</h3>
          <p>
            While we are good at what we do (and certainly make great plans),
            there’s always room for improvement and optimization. With each
            check in, milestone, or deadline, we assess the effectiveness of
            these strategies and remain open and active to change wherever
            needed. The best strategies are often those that adapt to their
            environments, and we are not shy of those changes coming our way.
